Dear obonet maintainers,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm a student working on an assignment related to code review and improvement. As part of this assignment, I've made some minor enhancements to the obonet codebase that I believe could be beneficial:

1. Added missing docstrings to some functions
2. Improved PEP 8 compliance by splitting some long lines
3. Renamed a few variables to follow snake_case convention
4. Added type hints to function signatures

These changes aim to improve code readability and maintainability without altering the functionality. I'd be happy to discuss any questions or concerns you might have about these changes.

Thank you for maintaining this valuable project, and for considering my contribution.

Best regards,
Syed Muhammad Murtaza Ali Zaidi
